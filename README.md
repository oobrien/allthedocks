# allthedocks

Route planning.

Working map at https://map.allthedocks.com/

The GPX files each contain 7 routes (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

The map uses the GPX and TSV files here on GitHub, plus a local DB API call to get the visited list and time.  

V1 published late on 3 July 2023.

V2 published on 6 July 2023 pm, updated S route to include a new docking station and a removal, and P route for a removal. To keep the numbers the same, an S was moved to P and S gained an extra docking station at the end. Also minor update to S, P and N to fix a number sequence typo.

V3 published late on 7 July 2023, update routes to reflect two removals. Now 161 in total for all teams. Also some rerouting based on a TSP solver's suggestions.
