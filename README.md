Route planning.

Working map at https://misc.oomap.co.uk/atdmap/

The GPX files each contain 7 routes (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

Other possible variations that could be produced are:
* 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + 12 routes (straight-line) with routepoints (docks)
* 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

The map uses these files.
