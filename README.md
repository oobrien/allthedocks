Route planning.

Working map at https://misc.oomap.co.uk/atdmap/

GPX files:
* No suffix: 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)
* trk_rte: 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + 12 routes (straight-line) with routepoints (docks)
* rte_wpt: 12 routes (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

The map uses the no-suffix version.
