Route planning.

Working map at https://misc.oomap.co.uk/atdmap/

The GPX files each contain 12 routes (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

Other possible variations that could be produced are:
* 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + 12 routes (straight-line) with routepoints (docks)
* 12 single-segment tracks (along the streets) + all the waypoints (docks)

The map uses these files.

V3 published late 27 September 2022, tweaks near the end of the routes so they all finish at the same station and at the same predicted take.

V4 published late 30 September 2022, including a newly (re)opened docking station on the South route. This was the version used by the challenge.
